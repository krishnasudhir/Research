# Research Projects

This is the GitHub home for all my research projects:

**A Computational Approach to Predict Chances of Survival in Myocardial Infarction Patients Using Echo-cardiogram Measurements  _(NCSSM, Fall 2018)_**
> This project was done as part of NCSSM course work for ”Introduction to Computational Sciences”. As part of this study, a computational model was developed using logistic regression to predict the patients chances of survival using attributes derived from various measurements from echocardiograms as predictors.

 * Technology/Tools: R, RStudio, GNUPlot, Mathematica 

**Extraction and Expression of BfmR Protein in Acinetobacter baumannii for Inhibiting Desiccation Resistance _(East Carolina University, Summer 2018)_**
> This project was done at East Carolina University as part of NCSSM Summer Ventures program. The objective was to identify, and extract BfmR protein and thus the gene responsible for the antibacterial resistance in a strain of pathogens known as _acinetobacter baumanii_. [Read](BfmR.pdf)
